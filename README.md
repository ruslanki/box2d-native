# Notes from Alex Yau:
* Current version from zuker/box2d-native supports an older version of babel and swig, which contains removed methods in V8 - https://electronjs.org/blog/nodejs-native-addons-and-electron-5
* npm run patch_swig applies the patches outlined here - https://github.com/swig/swig/issues/1520
Run the following to install
```
npm install node-gyp -g
npm install
```
Then copy the `build/Release/Box2D.node` binding file to host project.
On host project, run
```
npm install --save bindings
```
and require the file by
```
var bindings = require('bindings')('Box2D.node');
```

# box2d-native
[Box2D](http://box2d.org/) v2.3.1 as native Node.js addon.

## Details

Box2D compiled as static library, Node.js C++ addon produced by [swig](http://www.swig.org/).

## Install

Requires `curl`, `make`, `cmake`, `g++`. See also requirements for building [swig](http://www.swig.org/) and [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp)

Install with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install node-gyp -g
npm install box2d-native
```

**IMPORTANT:** Installation tested only on Linux with Node.js >= 4.2.1 and gc++ 4.9.

## Usage

```javascript
import {World, Vec2, BodyDef, Body} from 'box2d-native';

let world = new World(gravity);
let body = world.CreateBody(new BodyDef());

world.Step(1 / 60, 3, 3);
```

Original "namespaced" Box2D classes (`b2Vec2`, `b2World`...) are also exposed.

## Demo

```
npm install node-gyp -g
git checkout https://github.com/zuker/box2d-native.git

## TODO

 - Improve demo (implement all stuff from C++ Box2D testbed).
 - Refactor build, use more convenient tool.
 - Provide more benchmark results to compare with.
 - Tests.
